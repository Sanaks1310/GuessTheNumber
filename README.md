# GuessTheNumber

# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)
This is a simple command-line game built with Python where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## 🚀 How it works
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- The game provides hints:
   - If the guess is too low, it asks the user to guess higher.
   - If the guess is too high, it asks the user to guess lower.
- The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or types `Quit`.

## 🛠️ Features
- Random number generation using Python's `random` module
- Input validation (to avoid crashes if input is invalid)
- User-friendly messages and flow
- Exit the game anytime by typing `Quit`

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
